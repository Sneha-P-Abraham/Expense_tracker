# Expense_tracker
 mini project 

 The Expense Tracker is a simple and responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users manage their daily and monthly expenses with ease. It allows users to add, edit, and delete transactions, categorize their spending, and visualize trends through dynamic charts. All data is stored locally in the browser using Local Storage, ensuring persistence without requiring a backend database.
